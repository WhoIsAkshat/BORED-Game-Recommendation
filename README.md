## Algorithms

- Cosine Similarity: Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors. In the game recommendation system, it is used to calculate the similarity between the user's preferences and the features of different games. This allows the system to recommend games that are most similar to the user's preferences.

- Count Vectorizer: Count vectorizer is used to convert text data (e.g., game descriptions) into numerical representations (vectors). It creates a matrix of word counts, which is then used as input for the cosine similarity calculation. This allows the system to compare the textual features of games and recommend games with similar descriptions.

- PorterStemmer: PorterStemmer is a natural language processing tool used to stem words, i.e., reduce words to their root form. This helps in reducing the dimensionality of the data and capturing the essence of the words, making the cosine similarity calculation more effective and efficient.

- Streamlit: Streamlit is a Python library used for building web applications. It is used in the game recommendation system to create an interactive user interface where users can input their preferences, view recommended games, and provide feedback. Streamlit allows for easy integration of data visualization, input widgets, and interactive components in the web application.

- Web Scraping: Web scraping is used to collect game data from external sources, such as game descriptions, genres, ratings, and images. This data is then used to build the recommendation system. Popular Python libraries, such as BeautifulSoup and Requests, can be used for web scraping.

- Streamlit-Authenticator: Streamlit-Authenticator is a Streamlit extension that provides authentication and authorization capabilities to Streamlit applications. It can be used to add user authentication and authorization to the game recommendation system, allowing for personalized recommendations based on user profiles and preferences.

- Deta DB: Deta DB is a cloud-based database service used to store and retrieve data for the game recommendation system. It provides a simple and scalable solution for storing game data, user preferences, and feedback, allowing for efficient data retrieval and management in the system.
